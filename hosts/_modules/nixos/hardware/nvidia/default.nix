  # note:
  # nixpkgs.config.cudaSupport = true; would build all packages that offer cuda with CUDA support
  # Unfortunately, this would have some big drawbacks:
  # - CUDA stuff is not in cache.nixos.org (since unfree)
  # - would have to build everything from source, or from 'nix-community', take 2-3 hours
  # - CUDA stuff is not build by Hydra -> builds tend to fail more often since it's not tested
  # - packages like webkitgtk receive a lot of updates, and take a long time to build
  # -> CUDA support enabled for the whole system is neither practical nor necessary
  # -> we should enable CUDA support for specific packages only
  # example: pkgs.cuda-app.override { cudaSupport = true; };
